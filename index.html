								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<span><small>by Sid Chou </small> / <small> <i class="icon-comment"></i> 05.01.2020</small></span>
								<p>Having gone through two years at ITP, I’m sure I’m not alone in saying that we have all become pretty good at figuring things out through research, whether for a scientific study or to learn more about something like electronic circuitry.
									Despite doing a lot of this kind of research, we still often struggle with it for any number of reasons. Sometimes, the documentation isn’t clear, sometimes the explanations are too high or low level (too abstract or too detailed), and
									sometimes the technology described is out of date or obsolete. This is the motivation for my thesis project. In particular, I chose the topic of energy monitoring, which is something I’ve worked on a lot during my time at ITP with one of
									the clubs, ITPower, spending time searching for relevant resources, confronting roadblocks and making mistakes. I’ve learned that energy monitoring is important because most people are unaware of how much power they consume using shop
									equipment, especially when certain machines are left on, which is not good for energy conservation and can also be costly. The goal for my thesis project was to make a repository of information about energy monitoring in maker spaces, shops
									or at home, documenting not only my learning journey, but also providing a road map for others to use to better understand and build their own energy monitors.</p>
									<br>
								<p>As mentioned above, my thesis project originated from the work I did with the ITPower Club.
									The initial goal of the ITPower club was, I think, to reduce energy waste on the laser cutter. This
									goal was determined before I joined. Unfortunately, the ITPower Club project wasn’t completed,
									and is now on pause. Consequently, part of my thesis research was investigating why the
									project wasn’t completed and figuring out what was still left to be done. I also searched for other
									methods of building current sensors beyond what we were doing in the ITPower Club. When I
									found a variety of “how to” tutorials out there, I decided to focus my thesis effort on collecting
									and organizing the available information. Consequently, my thesis prototype became a web
									platform for citizen scientists and STEM enthusiasts to learn more about DIY power monitoring.
									An additional audience for my website may be people with energy consumption concerns at
									home, as I found through my research, that informational material and programs can be
									successful in helping people achieve higher energy efficiency at home.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									My thesis project, DIY Energy, is a website that provided information about different methods for understanding and monitoring energy consumption. This kind of information is typically available as either open source or closed source. Open
									source materials are usually more flexible, but require more work to set up. On the other hand, closed source materials allow users to basically get to work out of the box. With only a simple installation or even paying someone for
									installation, with closed source materials you can have something working without having to build or add anything yourself, either with an app or ready-made web-based software. Sometimes, closed source products provide you with an API to
									access your data for other purposes, however, data privacy is a concern in this day and age.

									More on the Project or Further reading (up to 1,500 words) *optional - This should be a free space, where students can explain your project more fully: a deeper description, a personal statement, your process, user testing,etc. You can do
									that by including hyperlinks here, or embedding video, images, gifs, or sound files.
